# Glympse EnRoute SDK for Xamarin

## Overview

Glympse EnRoute SDK for Xamarin is s library designed to wrap native EnRoute SDKs
and expose cross-platform interface available for use in Xamarin Forms application.

## Architecture

The idea behind proposed solution architecture is to wrap iOS and Android bindings
(generated by Xamarin SDK based on mapping files) into common interface that is exposed to
and consumed by shared code layer (Xamarin Forms application).

The following major components are included in Glympse EnRoute SDK for Xamarin.

### Glympse EnRoute Api

Defines interfaces accessible from common code. Those interfaces match
public interface of Glympse EnRoute SDK.

```
./source/EnRouteApi
```

### Glympse Android Bindings

Defines Jave->C# mappings and provides implementation of interfaces defined in Glympse EnRoute Api.

```
./source/EnRouteApiAndroid
```

### Glympse iOS Bindings

Defines ObjC->C# mappings and provides implementation of interfaces defined in Glympse EnRoute Api.

```
./source/EnRouteApiiOS
```

## Native Glympse EnRoute SDK

Native SDK packages are required in order to get Xamarin projects to compile.
Follow these steps to be able to build library projects and/or demo application.

- Place EnRoute SDK zip files under ```./tools``` directory.
- Run ```./unpack.sh``` from within ```./tools``` directory.
